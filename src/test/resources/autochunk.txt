This is a bunch of text which should be grouped
in two separate paragraphs. They are separated by
at least one line of whitespace in between them,
which should be the signal that the paragraph is 
really ending.

The text also is part of the root element, which
is one of the elements on the autoChunk list (together
with div and li) which is necessary for autochunking
to occur.

Third paragraph of text to sandwich
the middle one

Single lines have the p tags on the same line

autochunks look just like manually created blocks, 
except their indentation is different.

    Manually created blocks result in indented HTML,
    while autochunks follow the indentation level of
    the original source

-   This is testing auto
    chunking on lists

    The first list item should not be
    auto chunked.
-.. 
    The subsequent list item, on the
    other hand, should be, as it is
    followed by the autochunk token ..

    So each block of text should get
    wrapped in its own paragraph

    and single lines get an inline paragraph
